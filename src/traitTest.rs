/*
1. Definition and Purpose:
A trait in Rust is a collection of methods that types can implement. Traits are used to define shared behavior across different types. They are similar to interfaces in other languages, like Java or C#.

2. Method Signatures and Default Implementations:
Traits can include method signatures (methods without bodies) that the implementing type must define. Traits can also provide default method implementations, which implementing types can override. Take note that traits can not have fields.

3. Trait Implementation:
A type implements a trait by providing concrete implementations for the traitâ€™s methods. This is done using the impl TraitName for TypeName syntax.

4. Trait Bounds:
Traits can be used as bounds in generic functions or structs, ensuring that the generic type implements a particular trait. For example, fn print_name<T: Person>(t: T) ensures that T implements the Person trait.

5. Dynamic Dispatch:
Traits can be used with dynamic dispatch via dyn Trait. This allows for runtime polymorphism, where the exact method implementation to call is determined at runtime. However, this comes with a performance cost compared to static dispatch.

6. Object Safety:
Not all traits can be used as trait objects (dyn Trait). For a trait to be "object-safe," it must meet certain conditions, such as not having methods that return Self or methods that have generic type parameters.

7. Trait Inheritance:
Traits can inherit from other traits, allowing for a hierarchy of traits. This means that a trait can require the implementation of another trait.

8. Associated Types:
Traits can define associated types, which are types that are associated with the trait and can vary depending on the implementation. For example, the Iterator trait has an associated type Item that represents the type of value yielded by the iterator.

9. Using Traits for Abstraction:
Traits are commonly used to create abstractions in Rust. For example, the Iterator trait abstracts over different types of iterators, and the Display trait abstracts over different types that can be converted to a string.

10. Deriving Traits:
Rust provides the ability to automatically implement certain traits for types using the #[derive] attribute. Commonly derived traits include Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, and Eq.

11. Orphan Rule:
Rust enforces the "orphan rule," which means you can only implement a trait for a type if either the trait or the type is defined in the current crate. This prevents potential conflicts between implementations in different crates.

12. Auto Traits:
Some traits, like Send and Sync, are automatically implemented for types when certain conditions are met. These are known as "auto traits."
